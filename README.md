##Crowdsourced Tibetan Dictionary

Enables Translators and students to make notes and comments about terminology

This was an idea I have been throwing around in my head for a while. I wanted a place where I could save my own comments and ideas about terminology that I heard from different teachers and mentors.
Often, these amazing insights are now lost in a pile of notebooks, handwritten and unreadable.

### Who is this for?
- students can keep translation notes
- teachers can create vocab lists to share with students
- academics and translators can store text references and share them with colleagues
- translators can "up-vote" other translators' comments and entries.
- any student of Tibetan language to store and share their ideas and the wisdom of others.
- publishers and authors can add book glossaries

##Dreams and Goals - current todo list

1. search the Rangjung Yeshe Dictionary
1. add entries to personal dictionary for searching
1. share dictionaries with others
1. comment on entries / group discussion
